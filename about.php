The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. Camelot!

Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

And the hat. She's a witch! Well, what do you want? We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. I have to push the pram a lot. We want a shrubbery!!

Well, she turned me into a newt. The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. What do you mean? Did you dress her up like this?

Burn her anyway! Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot!

On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! Well, we did do the nose. Why do you think that she is a witch? On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place.

What a strange person. I'm not a witch. Did you dress her up like this? No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Well, I didn't vote for you.

The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. Camelot! The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!

We want a shrubbery!! Where'd you get the coconuts? Well, how'd you become king, then? Why? And the hat. She's a witch!

A newt? Now, look here, my good man. What do you mean? Well, I didn't vote for you. Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot!

I'm not a witch. Be quiet! You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! Look, my liege! Be quiet! We found them.

Who's that then? But you are dressed as one… We found them. It's only a model. …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Why?

Burn her anyway! The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. Burn her anyway! Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed!
