### Some Notes Before Grading:
- **Contact form doesn't work at the moment.** 
    - The Heroku SMTP add-on SimplyMail locked my account during testing, so I'll figure that out later. 
- **New workspace and new element forms are *ugly.*** 
    - Was going to wait until next homework to make them look pretty, because their functionality/look is going to change a bit with JavaScript.
- **Text in notes don't save at the moment.**
    - Want to implement that with JavaScript so the user will be able to edit the text right in the text area.

  I figure you are going to want to make a new account to test the registration functionality, but I've also created a test account for you with pre-loaded workspaces and images.
